        <p>I want to tell you about one of my favourite hobbies, which is cooking.  I love to cook homemade meals, because they are healthy, less fattening and nutritious to eat.

            My favourite things that I like to cook are; chicken bryani noodles and vegetables, pasta with tomato sauce or tuna casserole.
        
            Cooking to me is also an enjoyable thing to do as well as it being a special hobby.

            I encourage people to take this opportunity to make healthy cooking a part of their everyday lifestyle.

            From what I know, a lot of people eat the wrong foods at the wrong time; so they will make up excuses for not eating healthy.  It’s no wonder people are extremely obese and they should take proper care of themselves.  Those kinds of  people just don’t want to listen to their physicians.  That’s why people have health problems such as heart attacks, which could lead to possible death.

            Please think of healthy cooking as a hobby and a healthy lifestyle to you and your family.
